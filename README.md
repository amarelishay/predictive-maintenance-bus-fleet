# Predictive Maintenance – Bus Fleet (Dual Horizon ML System)

This repository contains a full-scale, production-grade predictive maintenance system designed to forecast mechanical failures in a bus fleet. The solution uses dual-horizon modeling to detect both imminent failures (7 days) and longer-term structural issues (30 days).

The full source code and detailed documentation for this project live inside the `predictive-maintenance-bus-fleet` directory of this repository. Navigate to that folder to access the pipeline, modeling code, and project-specific README.

## Key Features

- Dual-horizon predictive modeling: short-term (7‑day) and long-term (30‑day) failure predictions.
- End-to-end, explainable ML pipeline integrated with Power BI and PostgreSQL.
- Automated feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and reporting.

## Getting Started

To explore the project:

1. Browse to the `predictive-maintenance-bus-fleet/` folder in this repository.
2. Open its `README.md` for a comprehensive overview, system architecture, and setup instructions.

This high-level README summarises the project and points you to the proper location for the full implementation.
